Weather Py Observable Trends
1.	By looking at Latitude vs Max Temperature, temperatures drop as we go towards the Northern Hemisphere reaching below 0 degrees Fahrenheit when you reach 60+ degrees North and rise to a range of 70-90 Degrees Fahrenheit as we reach the equator and drop slightly by 10-15 Degrees in the Southern Hemisphere. A peak in max temperature is observed near the equator. 
2.	By looking at the other charts that compare humidity, cloudiness and Wind Speed, we cannot make distinct observable trend analysis as they donâ€™t show us direct correlation. We may need to plot those 3 factors among the Max Temperatures to see if differences in temperature have more of an observable trend with humidity, cloudiness and wind speed as these are not easy for the viewer to distinguish without further explanation. 
3.	However, by comparing the Latitude vs Max Temp and the Latitude vs Humidity charts; we can conclude a correlation between higher temperatures and higher % of humidity. Additionally, majority of the cities have a range of wind speed between 0-15 mph.
